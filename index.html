    A personal stylist is concerned with an individual rather than a particular fashion brand.
    With the recent rise of fame for celebrity stylists, like Rachel Zoe, Trinny and Susannah, and Gok Wan, and of the glut of reality television shows featuring makeovers and the day-to-day lives of personal stylists (e.g., The Rachel Zoe Project[1][2]), the general public have heightened their interest and awareness in understanding the theory behind achieving styles that suit them. Personal stylists are now addressing this demand and serving the general public who view the service as a luxury but a beneficial experience.
